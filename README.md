# vulc_window

(better name pending)

this is a Rust/Vulkan project based on [the guide here](https://vulkano.rs/guide/introduction). With time it will evolve into something more

Current roadmap:

 - [ ] load images and use them as textures
 - [ ] capture mouse/keyboard events and move camera around
 - [ ] add point lights and implement basic lighting algorithms
 - [ ] load fonts, render text and implement basic UI
 - [ ] load multiple .fbx files into the scene
 - [ ] load animations from .fbx and show them
